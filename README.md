# DynamicBannerTS
This is a small code for an Dynamic Banner you can use for TeamSpeak! You can also add it to a website!

I can use some feedback :)

You need a webserver with php 7x + GD Library extension

Banner live preview of how it looks like for me:
<img src="http://tsb.dsnakes.com/banner.php">

Configuration: 

        * create on your rootfolder of your website a new folder for the banner (as exemple Banner-ts)
        
        * change the path of your TeamSpeak 3 PHP Framework in line 5

        *  Modify your ts3 serverquery (line 8-10

        * add the font (RopaSans-Regular.ttf)  to the banner. (you can always use a font of your preference and change it (line 29)

        * add a background image in the banner folder and change the name to default.jpg (You can always change the name of the image or file format in the config (line 32)

        * add your logo to the folder and name it logo.png (you can always change the name/format it in the config (line 58)

just rember to crefit me if you would share this to other people!
